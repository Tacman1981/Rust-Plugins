miscellaneous plugins go here. Free to use for all, but use at your own risk. Some might not be well optimised yet.

If you use any of my plugins, firstly thank you, but most importantly let me know if issues arise by using the issues tab.
I am always looking to improve how things work if they are not optimal too. I do not have the luxury of time to fully test functionality.
